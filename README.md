## License and Philosophy

This software was created as a personal tool for managing diabetes. I share it freely in the hope that it helps others learn from their disease. It is licensed under **GPLv3** to ensure it remains open and cannot be privatized.

I do not accept donations or profit from this work â€” I simply ask that if it helps you, **pay it forward** by contributing, whether it be through:

- Submitting bug reports
- Opening a pull request
- Simply spreading the word

Diabetes is hard enough. No one should profit at the expense of those who suffer from it.
